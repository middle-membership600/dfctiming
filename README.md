# STM Drift Correction Timing and Sparse Sampling: A Novel Research Exploration

## Project Description

This project focuses on an important aspect of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), a revolutionary tool that has significantly improved our understanding of materials' electronic structure at an atomic level. Our key aim is to explore the timing of drift correction in the context of sparse sampled reconstruction in STM imaging, which has not been systematically investigated before.

## Problem Statement

STM imaging requires precise drift correction to combat the slight movements of the scanning tip or sample caused by thermal or mechanical effects. Such correction is critical for accurate, high-resolution imaging. With traditional STM imaging, this correction is usually performed on a full grid map. However, the adoption of sparse sampling methods, enabled by compressed sensing algorithms, raises a significant question: Is it reasonable to perform drift correction after the image has been reconstructed from a sparse sampling map?

## Project Objectives

This research aims to determine whether effective drift correction can be performed post-image reconstruction from sparse sampling maps. To achieve this, we will investigate the impact of drift correction timing on the reconstructed image. More specifically, we will evaluate how the quality of the reconstructed image, as determined by key metrics such as the signal-to-noise ratio and the square residual of the Fourier Transform after masking out Bragg peaks, is affected by the timing of the drift correction.

## Relevance and Potential Impact

Understanding the optimal timing for drift correction in the context of compressed sensing for STM imaging is a unique contribution to the field. With the increasing application of compressed sensing in STM imaging, the knowledge derived from this study could offer a revolutionary leap in STM imaging process. It could potentially introduce greater flexibility and efficiency, especially if drift correction proves effective after image reconstruction from sparse sampling maps.
